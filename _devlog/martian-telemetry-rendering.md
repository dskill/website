[Photographs Showing Landscape, Geological,and Other Features of Portions of the Planet Mars](http://ethanjackson.net/index.php/site/works_intro/C7/) I collaborated with Reed College Professor Ethan Jackson and fellow students John Waugh and Laura Diamond to generate and render NASA telemetry data from mars. Instead of focusing on photorealism, we experimented with notions of visualization and the presentation of an impossibly distant place. This was my introduction to mesh/billboard particle instancing, procedural mesh generation, and melscript in Maya.
