Here's a little test I threw together to explore how First Person Shooters might work with Leap Motion.  Never tried this in VR, but I'm certain it would be awesome.

<div class="experience-video">

    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
    loading="lazy"
  ></iframe>
</div>
