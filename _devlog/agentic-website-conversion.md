![Squarespace to GitHub Pages]({{ '/assets/images/devlog/agentic-website-conversion/squarespace-to-githubpages.jpg' | relative_url }})

The push to rebuild my site on GitHub Pages started as a practical alternative to Squarespace, but it quickly became a project about creative freedom. Running everything out of this repository means I finally have a transparent system where every page, asset, and layout is visible, versioned, and easy to change. The contrast with my old Squarespace setup is night and day: instead of feeling boxed in by their editor, I now have full ownership over the content I have been paying them to host for years.

The real breakthrough, though, is how well this new setup works with agents. Because the whole site lives in code, I can ask an agent to tweak the style of a section, rewrite copy, or automate the repetitive parts of publishing without worrying about a rigid UI fighting me. Delegating the tedious bits of documentation to an agent keeps my momentum up, and lets me focus on the creative decisions that actually matter.

This post is a perfect example. I am dictating it on my commute, handing the structure and formatting off to an agent.  The text is modified by me, and informed by the ongoing `agents.md` file where we have collaborated on the webscraping and the conversion. 

Under the old workflow I would have skipped documenting this entirely; now it is a lightweight task that fits into the cracks of my day.

**Documentation should not be the weak link in my creative chain.**
