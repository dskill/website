A [body tracking pose model](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/05/next-generation-pose-detection-with-movenet-and-tensorflowjs.html) that I’ve been prototyping with for the last year was just released by colleagues at Google.  It’s awesome. Super easy to use and extremely fast.

While we were prepping the launch I partnered with Google Research on interactive experiments, including a MoveNet-driven fluid simulator that runs entirely in the browser. [Here’s a clip](https://twitter.com/TensorFlow/status/1396918988660035589) of the webGL + TensorFlow.js demo in action.

Shoutout to the excellent [Fluid-JS library](https://github.com/malik-tillman/Fluid-JS) that drives the simulation.
