This is a music visualization I made for a song from our (currently unnamed) band. The track was from a rough practice session, but my bandmate Matthew did an awesome job remixing it for Earth Day 2011. I decided to revisit it in honor of Earth Day 2012 (April 22nd). The solar system itself is pretty rough here - planet orbital distances and period's should be roughly correct, and I scaled the planets up so you can see them. It's not particularly interactive, mostly just for listening and watching.

Check it out for yourself in the web player, or download the native PC or Mac client.
