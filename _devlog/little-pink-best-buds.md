**Little Pink Best Buds** was created by a team at Double Fine under the leadership of [Pendleton Ward](http://buenothebear.com/) for **Amnesia Fortnight 2014**.  This extremely ambitious game allowed players to communicate with the pink buds by typing dialog into a chat system.  Beyond that, I won't even try and describe it.  My major contributions were technical art, visual effects and lighting.  Although the **procedural, ray marched grass shader** is what I'm most proud of.
