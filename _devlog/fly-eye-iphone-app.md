[Fly Eye](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fly-eye/id435874532?mt=8) - my experiment in creative coding is out on iPhone.  It's simple, but I wanted to take something from start to finish in 1 month.  I *almost* made it - the app was accepted 31 days after starting the project.   30 days is coincidentally, the amount of time apple will let you hang onto a macbook pro before returning it.  Probably because they know after 30 days and a lot of late nights learning how to use xcode you won't want to...
