I’m not a fan of NFT’s in most cases, but generative art is an important exception. NFT’s allow people to generate, share, own, and trade unique instances of algorithmically generated work.

[FXHash](https://www.fxhash.xyz)provides a great way to experiment. The block chain it runs on (XTZ) is efficient and the costs across the board are low.  Great for creative explorations and expression.

I’ve been exploring generative pieces that create audio & visuals, in a deeply interconnected way.  You can find them all [here.](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/dskill)
