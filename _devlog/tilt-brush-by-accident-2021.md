Patrick Hackett and I had the pleasure of giving a talk on the [origin of Tilt Brush](https://www.museumor.com/blog/tilt-brush-by-accident-by-guest-speakers-drew-skillman-and-patrick-hackett) in the Museum of other Realities (MOR).   It was awesome and surreal giving an entire talk in VR. The whole thing felt surprisingly intimate.
