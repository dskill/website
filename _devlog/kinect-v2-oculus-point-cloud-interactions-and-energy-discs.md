A recent experiment combining point cloud and skeletal data from the Kinect 2 with Oculus. I'm convinced the representation of the user's body in VR space is critical to creating a feeling of presence. Even raw data like what you see here is enough to make a huge difference. My mind is exploding with all the possibilities!
