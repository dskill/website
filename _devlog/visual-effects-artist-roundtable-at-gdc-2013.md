*The Visual Effects Artist Roundtable*[http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/14154607/Visual_Effects_Artist_Roundtable](http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/14154607/Visual_Effects_Artist_Roundtable) is back for GDC 2013!  Last year was the first year we did it, and it was a *huge *success. Before the roundtable I was in contact with about 5 visual effects artists.  Now we've created a community of over 200 phenomenal real time visual effects artists.  Amazing. Here are the notes from last year's roundtable in case you missed it:
