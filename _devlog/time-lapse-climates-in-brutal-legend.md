This is a video showcasing the climate system for Brutal Legend. I collaborated with the engineering department (primarily our lead programmer Nathan Martz) to create a system that would seamlessly blend between different regional climates, different times of day, and different weather patterns (rain, snow, thunder, meteors, fog, etc...). For the skies in this sequence, I authored the effects, vortex shader and mesh, lighting, and sky box.
