This video showcases the climate variation in Brutal Legend. The first half of the video is time lapse, the second have shows different environments in real time. I authored all the scenes seen here using our climate system, which controls particle effects, fogging, lighting, weather variation, and post processing. See the [Brutal Legend VFX Presentation from GDC 2010]({{ '/assets/downloads/GDC2010_VFX.pdf' | relative_url }})Â for more details.
