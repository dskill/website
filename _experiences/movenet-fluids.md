title: "MoveNet Fluids"
---

Over the course of 2020, I collaborated with Google Research to explore the intersection of pose detection and interactive experiences. [Here is one example demo](https://twitter.com/TensorFlow/status/1396918988660035589) that combines webGL, TensorFlowJS and MoveNet.

Shoutout to the great [fluidJS library](https://github.com/malik-tillman/Fluid-JS) it's built on.
