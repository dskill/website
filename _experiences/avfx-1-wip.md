What is this?

The AVFX-1 is a hobby project that explores audio visual effects for real time music. Audio effects can be just about anything you can dream up, and are tightly coupled to visual effects which can also be just about anything. The audio effect can influence the visuals, and/or the visuals can influence the audio effect.

This project has been a lot of fun to work on, and is the 3rd iteration building on some prior experiments see [prior work and special thanks] sections.

I've made a handful of these for friends, but currently don't have any plans beyond that other than using this as a dev kit for my own audio visual explorations
