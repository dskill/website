title: "My Alien Buddy"
---

**My Alien Buddy** was a collaboration between Double Fine and Japan Studio (Sony) for the PS4 launch title Playroom. We wanted to apply our experience with Kinect to the PlayStation 4's camera and the new DualShock controller. Although the schedule was tight (five months!) we rapidly prototyped ideas in Unity and built an experience that showcased the hardware while staying fun to pick up and play. I served as Project Lead and handled visual effects, production, lighting, gameplay programming, and design.
