# GitHub Pages Site

This repository hosts a GitHub Pages-powered site. It currently includes a simple placeholder page so you can verify the publishing workflow end-to-end.

## Local development

1. Ensure you have Ruby (>= 3.0) and Bundler installed (`gem install bundler` if you need it).
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Serve locally using the GitHub Pages configuration: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
4. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to confirm the "Hello, world!" placeholder renders.

GitHub Pages will build this site using the same configuration, so what you see locally should match production.
